My favorite memories of my childhood are going on crazy adventures hiking with my dad. This developed into a love of the outdoors and led me to obtain a degree in ecology.

I also love to design, build, and generally make things. As a full stack web developer I get to use my knowledge in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node, and Python to build exciting systems everyday. I also get to see ecology from another perspective and contribute to the conversation on using technology to better our world.
